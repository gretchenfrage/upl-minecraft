## Server Administration README

This server must:
1. Run MC 1.12.2
2. Run Forge Mod Loader (FML)
3. Support password-passed offline sessions, since some friends
   don't have MC accounts. This means serverside plugins.

We're using the [SpongeForge](spongepowered.org) MC server
because it supports Forge mods and serverside plugins simultaneously, 
and is not abandoned.

([link to sponge docs for setting up server](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/index.html))

We're using SpongeForge build `1.12.2-2838-7.1.11-RC4007`, the Download
of which has been included in this repo as `spongeforge-1.12.2-2838-7.1.11-RC4007.jar`.

This SpongeForge build requires precisely Forge version `14.23.5.2838`,
the download of which has been included in this repo as 
`forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2838-installer.jar`.
